# Adult_Census_Income_Prediction
The Adult Census Income project aims to predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and employment data. This project uses the UCI Adult dataset, also known as the "Census Income" dataset, which includes information such as age, education, occupation, and more.
